This repo contains the Jupyter notebook, and YouTube video of the presentation, for my final project for my Introduction to Deep Learning class, part of University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science program. The goal for this project was to create a model that would do well in predicting house prices in Amsterdam using ANN and regression.
